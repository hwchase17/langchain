Elephants lay single eggs (ovoids) that weigh up to 11 pounds.', ' Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair, and that produce milk for their young.  The biggest eggs are laid by birds, not mammals.', ' Mammals lay eggs, but none of them lay really large eggs. The biggest eggs are laid by reptiles, birds, and fish, not mammals. Therefore, the answer is that no mammal lays the biggest eggs.', ' Mammals are warm-blooded, vertebrate animals that typically bear live young.  So, the answer to this question would not be a mammal, as mammals do not lay eggs.  The answer to this question would be a reptile, as reptiles lay the largest eggs of all animals.', \"\\n\\nFirst, let's consider which mammals lay eggs. Mammals that lay eggs include the platypus, echidna, and the spiny anteater.\\n\\nNext, let's look at the size of their eggs. The largest egg laid by any mammal belongs to the echidna, which can lay eggs up to 2.5 inches in diameter. The platypus lays eggs that are only around 0.75 inches in diameter, while the spiny anteater lays eggs that are between 0.43-0.75 inches in diameter.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that the echidna lays the biggest eggs of any mammal.\", ' Mammals are warm-blooded animals, typically characterized by having hair or fur and giving birth to live young. This eliminates any birds, which lay eggs but do not give birth to live young.\\n\\nThe largest mammal egg is laid by the elephant. While the average elephant egg is the size of a ping-pong ball, the largest elephant egg on record was about the size of a grapefruit.', '\\n\\n1. Mammals are typically viviparous, meaning that they give birth to live young, rather than laying eggs. \\n\\n2. The only mammal that lays eggs is the echidna, also known as the spiny anteater. \\n\\n3. The echidna lays the largest eggs of any mammal, measuring about 1.4 inches (3.5 cm) in diameter.', \" Mammals are warm-blooded animals that nurse their young with milk, so they don't lay eggs. Therefore, the answer to this question is that no type of mammal lays the biggest eggs.\", ' Mammals are animals that give birth to live young and produce milk for their young. They do not lay eggs. Therefore, the answer to this question is that no type of mammal lays the biggest eggs.', ' Mammals are animals that are warm-blooded, have fur or hair, and produce milk for their young.  The largest eggs in the mammal family are laid by the elephant.  Elephant eggs, while they are still relatively small compared to other animals, are the largest eggs laid by any mammal.', '\\n\\n1. Mammals lay eggs, so we need to look at mammals that lay eggs. \\n\\n2. The mammals that lay eggs are monotremes, which are mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. \\n\\n3. The monotreme that lays the biggest eggs is the echidna, or spiny anteater. The eggs of an echidna can be up to 2 inches in diameter, making them the biggest eggs laid by any mammal.', '\\n\\nMammals are warm-blooded animals with fur and mammary glands for feeding their young. The largest mammal egg-laying species is the echidna, also known as the spiny anteater. These animals, which are native to Australia and New Guinea, lay eggs that can reach up to 2.7 inches in length and 1.1 inches in diameter.', '\\n\\nMammals lay eggs, so the first step is to identify what type of mammal lays eggs. The only mammal that lays eggs is the monotreme, which includes the platypus and the echidna. \\n\\nThe platypus lays the biggest eggs, measuring up to 1.2 inches in diameter.', ' Mammals are animals that give birth to young and nurse their young with milk from mammary glands.  Therefore, the mammal that lays the biggest eggs would be an egg-laying mammal, or monotreme. Monotremes include the platypus and the echidna, and they lay the largest eggs of any mammal.', ' Mammals are animals that give birth to live young and produce milk for their young. The largest mammal egg belongs to the elephant, which can weigh up to 2.2 pounds.', ' Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur and give birth to live young. The biggest eggs laid by a mammal would belong to the monotremes, which are a group of mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The two species of monotremes are the platypus and the echidna, and of these two species, the platypus lays the largest eggs.', '\\n\\nMammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their young with milk produced in their bodies.\\n\\nThe largest mammal egg is laid by the elephant. The largest elephant egg ever recorded weighed around 9 pounds.', ' Mammals are animals that are warm-blooded and have fur or hair. They give live birth to their young. The biggest egg laying mammal is the elephant. Elephants lay very large eggs, up to 13 inches in length and weighing up to 11 pounds.', ' First, what mammal is known for laying eggs? That would be a monotreme, or egg-laying mammal.  Examples of monotremes include the duck-billed platypus and the echidna.  Of these two, the echidna lays the biggest egg, with a diameter of 2-3 cm.', '\\n\\nFirst, we need to determine what type of mammal lays eggs. The only mammal that lays eggs is the monotreme, which includes the platypus and the echidna. \\n\\nSecond, we need to determine which species lays the biggest eggs. The biggest egg laid by a monotreme is the echidna egg, which can be up to 10 times bigger than a platypus egg. \\n\\nTherefore, the type of mammal that lays the biggest eggs is the echidna.', '\\n\\nFirst, mammals are a type of animal that gives birth to live young, rather than laying eggs. Therefore, the answer to this question is that no type of mammal lays the biggest eggs.', ' Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their young with milk produced by mammary glands.  The largest mammals are whales.  However, whales do not lay eggs, so they are not the correct answer.  The biggest egg-laying mammal is the platypus.  Platypus eggs are about 2 cm in diameter, making them the largest eggs laid by any mammal.', ' Mammals are animals that give birth to live young, so the answer would have to be a mammal that gives birth to live young and lays eggs. The answer is the echidna, a spiny anteater that lives in Australia and New Guinea. Echidnas lay the biggest eggs of any mammal, with a single egg measuring up to 3.2 cm in length and weighing around 8-12 g.', ' Mammals lay eggs, so the answer to this question would be a mammal that lays the biggest eggs. The largest mammal that lays eggs is the elephant. Elephants lay the largest eggs of any mammal, measuring up to 12 inches in length and weighing up to 2.2lbs.', ' Mammals are warm-blooded animals that give birth to live young and typically have fur or hair.  The biggest egg-laying mammal is the African elephant. Elephants lay a single egg, which is the largest single egg of any mammal.']}\n",
